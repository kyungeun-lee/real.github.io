**Representation Analysis & Application Lab. @ Inha University**

We study **learned representations in deep learning** to improve generalization and to better understand the underlying mechanisms of neural networks, with a strong emphasis on **information-theoretic analysis**.

Building on this foundation, we develop machine learning algorithms for **real-world prediction problems**, particularly in practical application scenarios involving **tabular and structured data**. 

Our current research interests include:
- Information-theoretic analysis of generalization in deep neural networks  
- Learning and inference on tabular data  
- Multimodal learning with structured data
