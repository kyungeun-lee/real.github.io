**Representation Analysis Lab. @ Inha University**

**학부 연구생 또는 석/박사 진학을 희망하는 학생들은 메일로 간단한 CV와 함께 연락주세요.**

We study representation analysis and develop machine learning methods with a focus on practical prediction problems.

Current Research Interests: Representation Learning, with a focus on 

- information-theoretic analysis on generalization in deep neural networks,

- applications to tabular data, and 

- multimodal learning with tabular data.
